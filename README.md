# Crytographic-PDF-Signer-GUI

Let's you invisibly sign PDF documents with a pfx or p12 (pkcs12) certificate
It signs the document using the PAdES-BASELINE-B signature format

You can check the signature validation from the generated PDFs with:

- https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/validation (use it just for test purposes, the files attached there are sent to EU Gov servers)
- Acrobat

# Recommended use for Windows users

Run the executable file fow Windows in the link below.

If you run the .exe through VirusTotal it may show 10 warnings of malware, those are false positives because the code is not signed, I will have to send a report to those AV companies claiming false positives.

In case that you do not want to use the executable or have a different OS you can find the instructions below in order to run the script with python.

# Prerequisites for running the script

Add Python and Python scripts to PATH

C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311

C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts

Doesn't need to be python 3.11, newer versions should work too.


Open CMD and add these libraries

```
pip install cryptography
pip install endesive
```

In case pip fails, try updating pip or use

```
python -m pip install cryptography
python -m pip install endesive
```

After those libraries are installed, just run the signer1.0.py scrip

I don't know the specifics to setup Python on Linux or MacOS, if you know how to please tell me.
